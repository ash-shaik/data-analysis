### Data Analysis

For anyone working with data, be it in data science or data engineering, curiosity is an absolute must. Asking the why behind the numbers
we see or generate. 
Whether it's looking at historical data to find patterns and anomalies or to make informed estimates of a metric or for troubleshooting, SQL is a powerful tool for this purpose.

When starting with a new analysis, start with the high level business understanding and parallely use queries to look for representation and correlation with data understanding. 

This repo is a set of useful query patterns. One can run these in the Mode analytics , against the public datasets.
